# React Client

This is a minimal React frontend for the LunchApp API. It fetches data from the `/api/WeatherForecast` endpoint and displays it.

## Setup

1. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd ReactClient
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and proxy API requests to `http://localhost:5000`.
